1. Create and activate the virtualenv:

   ```shell
   python3.10 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate

   formally to make sure you have the same version as what is used for cloudfoundry, use buildpack to install the same version e.g. https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases e.g. 22.1.2
   python -m pip install pip==22.1.2
   ```
